Welcome to Ichnosat
=============================


Ichnosat is an `Open Source <https://opensource.org/>`_ plugin based platform able to
download and process EO satellite data. It is written in
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and C++, has been designed and developed by `Raffaele Bua <https://buele.github.io>`_ for `Sardegna Clima Onlus NPO <http://www.sardegna-clima.it>`_. Downloads and Processes are multithreaded and schedulable.
The Platform is configurable and the *processor* is extendible via C++ plugins.


`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_  containers are included in the package, facilitating the installation and running.


Source code is released under
the `MIT  <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ license and it is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/SardegnaClimaOnlus/ichnosat/>`_.

The *downloader* gets automatically products from
`Sentinel-2 on AWS <http://sentinel-pds.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/>`_ portal. Such a downloader is multithreaded and can be
fully customized in terms of AOI (Area of Interest) and Products Sensing Time.

The *processor* gets products from the downloader
and processes products via C++ plugins. Current
version contains a single plugin able to extract from Sentinel-2 data the  `NDVI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index>`_  exploiting
`GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`_  library.


Ichnosat *processor* is multithreaded, extendible
via C++ plugins and customizable.
