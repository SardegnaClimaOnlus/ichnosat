Ichnosat is an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/)plugin based platform able to
download and process EO satellite data. It is written in
[Python](https://www.python.org/) and C++, has been designed and developed by [Raffaele Bua](https://buele.github.io) for [Sardegna Clima Onlus NPO](http://www.sardegna-clima.it). Downloads and Processes are multithreaded and schedulable.
The Platform is configurable and the *processor* is extendible via C++ plugins.


[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  containers are included in the package, facilitating the installation and running.


Source code is released under
the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license and it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SardegnaClimaOnlus/ichnosat/).

The *downloader* gets automatically products from
[Sentinel-2 on AWS](http://sentinel-pds.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) portal. Such a downloader is multithreaded and can be
fully customized in terms of AOI (Area of Interest) and Products Sensing Time.

The *processor* gets products from the downloader
and processes products via C++ plugins. Current
version contains a single plugin able to extract from Sentinel-2 data the  [NDVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index)  exploiting
[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)  library.


Ichnosat *processor* is multithreaded, extendible
via C++ plugins and customizable.
